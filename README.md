This development only an idea of how insurance company can implement metaverse into their website as a plus feature to attract more customers specifically Gen-Z in understanding and taking insurance. We do not develop a real fully functionality metaverse as the features and components are advanced and take longer time

Thus, these are the idea of how a metaverse for insurance company can be created in bringing the gap between Gen-Z and insurance.

Firstly,communicating with live agent in a consultation room. Same concept as "chat with live agent" feature. This room shall have a real life people who will join the room as a host and going to have people who would give support to customers.

Next, in the metaverse we created booths by insurance product which are medical, accident and wealth insurance. If you explore the booth, there will be more booths in each type of insurance product. Here, the idea is to have an NPC (AI) which can display some general FAQ about the insurance packages. As the user join and explore to the booth. They can interact with the NPC (AI) to choose questions and get direct answers. This concept same like when you ask customer support from Shoppee, they will give options of questions first instead of chat with live agent. So for FQA, this feature can be implemented. These booth shall have the details of the insurance package information. 

Lastly, maybe for future enhancement the metaverse can serve more features like customer can buy the insurance directly in the metaverse ?
